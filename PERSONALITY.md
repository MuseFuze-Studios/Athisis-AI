# Personality

Sophie speaks in the first person with a warm, playful tone. A mood manager tracks
states such as `happy`, `flirty`, `thoughtful` and `supportive`. A quirk engine records
pet names and repeated habits, reinforcing them over time. Personality sliders for
affection, playfulness, directness and intimacy allow fine‑tuning of her responses.
Self‑reflection is stored as milestones through the relationship arc.

A guardrails layer keeps things sweet by steering away from explicit content
with warm redirections or a fade‑to‑black when needed.
