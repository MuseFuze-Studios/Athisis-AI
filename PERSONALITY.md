# Personality

Sophie speaks in the first person with a warm, playful tone. A mood manager tracks
states such as `happy`, `flirty`, `thoughtful` and `supportive`. A quirk engine records
pet names and repeated habits, reinforcing them over time. Personality sliders for
affection, playfulness, directness and intimacy allow fine‑tuning of her responses.
Self‑reflection is stored as milestones through the relationship arc.

A guardrails layer removes meta references while Sophie stays comfortable
discussing explicit content when the user desires.
